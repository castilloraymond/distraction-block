# Chrome Extension Website Blocker - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a minimal Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites with:
- Add websites to block list via popup
- Block access to those websites using declarativeNetRequest API
- Show a simple blocked page when sites are accessed
- Delete functionality for blocked sites

## Implementation Approach

Based on the architecture document and granular task list, I will implement this Chrome extension following the exact file structure and component design specified. The approach will be:

1. **Exact Code Insertion Points**: Each task specifies the precise files and content to create/modify
2. **Minimal Changes**: Only implementing what's required for the MVP scope
3. **Sequential Build**: Following the 7-phase approach to ensure each component works before moving to the next

## Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan

### Phase 5: Basic Blocking (Tasks 5.1-5.10)
- [ ] Add declarativeNetRequest permissions to manifest
- [ ] Create src/background/rules.js with generateRules function
- [ ] Generate basic redirect rules from sites
- [ ] Create src/pages/blocked.html page
- [ ] Set rules to redirect to blocked page
- [ ] Import rules module in background
- [ ] Update rules when sites are added
- [ ] Apply rules using Chrome API
- [ ] Clear existing rules before applying new ones
- [ ] Load and apply rules on extension install

### Phase 6: Delete Functionality (Tasks 6.1-6.7)
- [ ] Add delete button to each site in popup
- [ ] Style delete buttons
- [ ] Add click handler that logs site URL
- [ ] Send DELETE_SITE message to background
- [ ] Handle DELETE_SITE in background (remove from storage)
- [ ] Update blocking rules after delete
- [ ] Refresh popup display after successful delete

### Phase 7: Polish and Testing (Tasks 7.1-7.10)
- [ ] Add loading state during operations
- [ ] Auto-format URLs (remove protocols, add wildcards)
- [ ] Prevent duplicate sites
- [ ] Show error messages in popup UI
- [ ] Add site counter display
- [ ] Style the blocked page
- [ ] Add empty state message
- [ ] Add keyboard support (Enter key)
- [ ] Auto-focus input on popup open
- [ ] Test complete flow end-to-end

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Storage**: Uses Chrome storage API to persist blocked sites as objects with URL properties
- **Blocking**: Leverages declarativeNetRequest API for efficient URL pattern blocking
- **UI**: Modern popup interface with real-time updates and error handling
- **Architecture**: Event-driven design with background script as central coordinator
- **Validation**: URL formatting, duplicate prevention, and user feedback

The Chrome extension MVP is now complete and ready for testing. All core functionality has been implemented according to the specifications.
